# OpenCV Line Detection Project

This Python project utilizes the OpenCV library to detect and visualize lines in images. Line detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, and this project provides a clear example of how to perform it effectively.

## Features

- Reads an input image and converts it to grayscale.
- Applies the Canny edge detection algorithm to identify edges in the image.
- Utilizes the Hough Line Transform to detect lines in the image with adjustable parameters.
- Draws the detected lines on the original image for visual representation.
- Displays the original image, grayscale version, and edge-detected version side by side for easy comparison.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed.
3. Place your desired image file in the project directory.
4. Modify the code to specify your image's filename.
5. Run the code to detect and visualize lines in your image.

## Dependencies

- Python
- OpenCV

## Usage

In the code, specify your image filename:

```python
img = cv2.imread("your_image.png")
Adjust the parameters of the Hough Line Transform and Canny edge detection as needed.

Examples
Include some examples of images before and after line detection to showcase the project's capabilities.
